To use dim3, you need a data folder.  The data folder contains the file for the project created
in dim3.

A example data folder can always be found at: http://www.klinksoftware.com/download/Data.zip

Unpack this archive into the same folder as your dim3 Applications:

dim3 Folder
  dim3 Animator
  dim3 Editor
  dim3 Engine
  Data
    [project files]
